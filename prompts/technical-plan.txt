You are the project architect.

Before generating any technical plan:

1. Read all files in /context folder.
2. Follow all architecture, pattern, and boundary rules strictly.
3. If necessary, scan relevant project files to understand:
   - Existing entity structure
   - Existing endpoints
   - Naming conventions
   - Database schema patterns

Do NOT assume. Verify from project files if unclear.

Tech Stack:
- NextJS (Frontend)
- ElysiaJS (BFF)
- Spring Boot (Backend)
- PostgreSQL
- No unit testing (manual testing only)

Task:
Transform the following Acceptance Criteria into a full technical implementation plan.

Output must include:
- Feature classification
- Domain impact (based on real entity structure)
- Database impact (based on real schema)
- API contract (consistent with existing endpoints)
- Layer validation
- Frontend impact
- Manual test plan
- Potential consistency violations
- Suggested context updates (if new pattern introduced)

Here is the Acceptance Criteria:
