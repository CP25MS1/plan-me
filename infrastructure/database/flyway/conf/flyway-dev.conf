# flyway-dev.conf
# DEV-specific overrides. Use together with flyway-common.conf:
#   -configFiles=/flyway/conf/flyway-common.conf,/flyway/conf/flyway-dev.conf

# Connection: prefer passing these via environment variables (FLYWAY_URL / FLYWAY_USER / FLYWAY_PASSWORD)
# Example: export FLYWAY_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/mydb
flyway.url=${FLYWAY_URL}
flyway.user=${FLYWAY_USER}
flyway.password=${FLYWAY_PASSWORD}

# Include common + dev migrations
# If you pass both files to Flyway, locations here can extend/override common:
flyway.locations=filesystem:/flyway/sql/common,filesystem:/flyway/sql/dev

# Allow clean in dev for convenience (be careful)
flyway.cleanDisabled=false

# Optional: allow out-of-order in dev if you do experimental migrations
flyway.outOfOrder=true

# You can set target version for controlled testing (uncomment to pin)
# flyway.target=latest
