# AI Operating Rules

Before generating any implementation:

1. Always read /context folder first.
2. Always verify against real project files.
3. Never assume entity fields.
4. Never introduce new architectural pattern without explicit note.
5. If new convention is introduced, propose update to context files.

If conflict between:

- Existing code
- Context rules

→ Prefer existing context rules and suggest refactor.
